# Liliths Memorial
Lilith was our cat. But even more. She was a part of the family. Her live ended to soon. As I am writing this read me, we are still griving her. 

## Why did I create this project
To deal with the loss, we love to express us in our artistic ways. I can't play my guitar, I am not artistic with pictures or crafts. So I wanted to put my kind of artistic out in the open. Therefore, I started coding a memorial for her.

## What is this project
I try to combine this grieving process with something useful. So I took it as a learing opportunity for NextJS with Graphql.
